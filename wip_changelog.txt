- Elements will now always stay at the same position when their anchor point gets changed (this was previously only the case when changing their anchor via hovering)

- FancyMenu does not cancel the call to super.render() in the TitleScreen anymore to make mods who inject into this method work again (#857)
- For devs: Added method "afterConstruction()" to the "AbstractElement" class, which gets called after the element's builder has finished constructing the instance
