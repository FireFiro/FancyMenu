- Added "Sticky Anchor" mode for elements that makes them always keep the same distance to their anchor, no matter the element's size
- Added "Auto Sizing" mode for elements that makes them adjust their size automatically when the screen size changes (#838)

- Added "Color" background type, which is basically the one from Drippy, but ported to the base mod (#985)
- Added "Item" element to render items (sword, potato, etc.) in menus (#521)
- Added a parallax effect feature to the "Image" menu background type (supports inverted movement and customizable intensity) (#735)
- Added a parallax effect feature to all elements (supports inverted movement and customizable intensity)
- Added WHILE loop feature to the action script system (#1023)
- Added "Load Once Per Session" mode for all element types (#1019)
  - Enabling this will make the element only load once per game session (game restart = new game session)

- Added ability to set the weight of audio tracks in the Audio element to control how likely each track is to be selected in shuffle mode (#1020)
- You can now execute action scripts when opening and closing a screen (#1018)
- Menu backgrounds are stackable now, which means if you have multiple layouts with a background defined for the same menu, all backgrounds will get rendered now
  - Combining this with the new Parallax feature for Image backgrounds makes it possible to render layered parallax backgrounds
- Elements will now always stay at the same position when their anchor point gets changed (this was previously only the case when changing their anchor via hovering)
- The Title screen Copyright button's opacity is now capped at 0.4, so people can't make it invisible via the opacity setting anymore (#984)
- It is now possible to set the tint of "Image" elements (#873)
- FancyMenu does not cancel the call to super.render() in the TitleScreen anymore to make mods who inject into this method work again (#857)
- For devs: Added method "afterConstruction()" to the "AbstractElement" class, which gets called after the element's builder has finished constructing the instance
- Improved the logic behind layout indexes, so ordering happens earlier to catch more edge cases where it could apply parts of layouts in the wrong order
- Fixed being able to delete the Copyright button in the Title screen (#997)

- Fixed "Smaller Than" being forcibly replaced with "Smaller Than or Equals" in the "Is Number" requirement (#954)

  - The widgets now have custom identifiers
