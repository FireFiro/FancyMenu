CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.4.0 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]
 
- Added "Is Key Pressed" requirement to check for keyboard key presses (#966)
- Added "Sticky Anchor" mode for elements that makes them always keep the same distance to their anchor, no matter the element's size
- Added "Auto Sizing" mode for elements that makes them adjust their size automatically when the screen size changes (#838)
- Added "Plain Text" Markdown formatting code that ignores all formatting codes inside (similar to code block, but without the visible block) (#983)
- Elements will now always stay at the same position when their anchor point gets changed (this was previously only the case when changing their anchor via hovering)
- The Title screen Copyright button's opacity is now capped at 0.4, so people can't make it invisible via the opacity setting anymore (#984)
- Fixed being able to delete the Copyright button in the Title screen (#997)
- Fixed conflict with "Immersive Engineering" by disabling FancyMenu in all screens related to this mod (#965)
- Fixed "Smaller Than" being forcibly replaced with "Smaller Than or Equals" in the "Is Number" requirement (#954)
- Fixed typo in tooltip of Layout Index (#968)
- Fixed FM's menu bar not being clickable in the Create World screen until resizing the window in some cases (#1004)
