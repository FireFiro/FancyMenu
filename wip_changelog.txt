CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.5.0 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- Added "Last World or Server" placeholder that returns the last world/server or an empty value if no last world/server was set (#1091)
- Replaced the old hardcoded dummy Title screen elements (logo, splash, branding, realms button icons) with actual widgets, which means they can be moved now and basically work like Vanilla buttons
- Fixed raw text components fail to get parsed when they don't start with " { " (#1089)
-
